# Skin Cancer Detection: CNN vs SVM

Collaborators: Alessio Desideri


### The Project

Starting from over 27,000 dermoscopic images of moles and skin lesions sourced from the ISIC archive, the aim of this study is to compare the performance of two models — a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) — on a binary classification task (malignant cancer: yes/no).
